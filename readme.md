## 🚀 Projects
- **Circadian Light Strip** - ([GitHub](https://github.com/DanielFeldman1/circadian-light-strip)) - An automated, Wi-Fi-connected circadian lighting system using an ESP32 microcontroller and a WS2812B RGB LED strip. The lights automatically adjust their color temperature throughout the day to match natural light cycles, promoting a healthier sleep-wake rhythm.

- **Synthetic News** - ([GitHub](https://github.com/DanielFeldman1/synthetic-news)) - A news site that automatically generates a concise podcast episode every week. It utilizes AI agents to conduct research, write scripts, and create the final audio file, thereby saving listeners hours of reading and browsing the internet.

- **Synthetic Sentience** - ([GitHub](https://github.com/DanielFeldman1/synthetic-sentience)) - A proof-of-concept chatbot that uses Hugging Face Transformers for emotion classification of user input, dynamically adjusting its own “mood” in response. Detected emotions were amplified (e.g., +0.25 intensity) and decayed over time per message, allowing the bot’s tone and phrasing to shift in a way that loosely mirrored the user’s emotional state. The goal was to explore how machine learning can drive emotionally adaptive dialogue.

- **Downloads Organizer**   - ([GitHub](https://github.com/DanielFeldman1/folder-organizer)) - A simple and reversible Python script that organizes the files in your downloads folder by sorting and sending them into the right user folders by file types. (e.g: .mp3 -> Music)
